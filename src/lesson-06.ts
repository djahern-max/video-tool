/**
 * Lesson 06 — "Where the Heat Actually Went"
 * Course: Clean Ocean Energy Systems (Grade 10 Environmental Science, NOT CPE)
 *
 * LESSON NUMBERING. This is the sixth lesson module in the package but the
 * FIRST lesson of its course. `lessonId` is the package-wide id and drives the
 * audio directory; `eyebrow` is course-relative and reads "Lesson 01". They
 * disagree on purpose. Do not "fix" one to match the other.
 *
 * NOT CPE. `fieldOfStudy` is the non_cpe sentinel. This content is a high
 * school environmental science unit, deliberately non-financial, and it exists
 * to exercise the generic slide set against subject matter the package has
 * never seen. Do not let it acquire a real field of study.
 *
 * Maps to course learning objective 1: quantify the ocean's role as a global
 * heat reservoir by calculating absorbed thermal energy (Q = mcΔT) and
 * comparing water to air. One review question is tagged to this objective, and
 * it asks the student to read a temperature rise as an energy claim — so
 * block-03 has to actually do the arithmetic on screen, not gesture at it.
 *
 * SLIDE NOTE: blocks 03 and 06 are charts in the source deck — a cube-law bar
 * chart and a Carnot curve. There is no chart component, so both are authored
 * as `Calc` figures, which is arguably better here: the rows reveal one at a
 * time as the narrator reaches each number, which a static chart cannot do.
 * If a `Chart` component ever lands, swapping those figures is a re-render
 * only — narration and reveal counts are unaffected, so the audio survives.
 *
 * KNOWN DEFECT, not mine to fix here: `Title` in slides.tsx hard-codes the
 * strip "LESSON 2 OF 5 · SELF STUDY · ACCOUNTING". It will render that over
 * this lesson's title sheet. See the note at the bottom of this file.
 *
 * Types are imported from lesson-01, which is the single definition point.
 * Do not redefine Block or Figure here — two copies will drift.
 *
 * Reveal markers: [[r]] sits in `narration`, immediately before the WORD it
 * reveals. The number of markers in a block MUST equal the length of that
 * block's `reveals` array. Verify with
 * `npm run generate -- --lesson 06 --dry-run` before spending any credit.

      "a couple of percent. The rest is in seawater, and most of that in the top " +
      "two thousand metres. The reason is a property of water itself. [[r]]Water " +
      "stores heat in a way that essentially nothing else at the planet's surface " +
      "does, which is why the ocean can swallow that much energy and warm by only a " +
      "fraction of a degree. Hold on to that, because it has a second consequence " +

      "roughly a quarter of the carbon dioxide we have emitted, and it pays for " +
      "that in acidity — surface pH has fallen measurably since the industrial " +
      "revolution. Third, [[r]]gradients. Heat differences drive wind, wind drives " +
      "waves, and temperature layers drive circulation, so more stored energy means " +

/*
 * WHAT THIS LESSON FOUND OUT ABOUT THE GENERIC SLIDE SET
 * ------------------------------------------------------
 * This is the first lesson written against subject matter with no relationship
 * to the ones the components were designed for. Four findings, in order of how
 * much they cost:
 *
 * 1. `Title` is not generic. It hard-codes "LESSON 2 OF 5 · SELF STUDY ·
 *    ACCOUNTING" in its footer strip. Every lesson since 02 has been rendering
 *    lesson 02's position and lesson 02's field of study. It has been invisible
 *    because every lesson so far has been lesson-02-adjacent — same course,
 *    same field. This one is neither, and the strip is simply wrong on screen.
 *    Fix: move position, delivery method, and field of study into `meta` and
 *    read them, the way `courseTitle` and `lessonTitle` already are.
 *
 * 2. `Facts` and `Calc` are the same component wearing different labels. Both
 *    are label-left, monospace-value-right, one row per reveal. The only real
 *    differences are `rule` and `emphasis`, and there is no reason `Facts`
 *    could not carry both. Not urgent, but worth knowing before a seventh kind
 *    gets added.
 *
 * 3. `Compare` assumes the two columns share a row schema and does not enforce
 *    it. Both columns here use the same three labels, which is what makes the
 *    sheet readable — but nothing in the type would have stopped a lesson from
 *    giving one column four rows and the other two, producing a comparison
 *    that compares nothing. A shared `labels: string[]` plus per-column values
 *    would make the shape honest.
 *
 * 4. `List` numbers its items 01, 02, 03 unconditionally. That is right for an
 *    ordered process and wrong for an unordered set. Block-05 is genuinely
 *    ordered so it does not bite here, but the hazardous waste lessons authored
 *    unordered content as `List` too, and those are numbered as though sequence
 *    means something.
 *
 * None of the four are fixed in this file. Fixing 1 changes every existing
 * lesson's title sheet, which is a re-render of four videos and belongs in its
 * own feature with its own frame diff.
