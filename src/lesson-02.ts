/**
 * Lesson 02 — "Who Makes It, and How Much"
 * Course: Where Does It Actually Go? (hazardous waste, ESG/Sustainability)
 *
 * Types are imported from lesson-01, which is the single definition point.
 * Do not redefine Block or Figure here — two copies will drift.
 *
 * Duration resolution order: audio-meta-02.json first, estimatedSeconds
 * second. `estimatedSeconds` is Math.round(wordCount / 130 * 60). Note that
 * lesson 01 measured at roughly 163 wpm against this 130 wpm constant, so
 * these estimates run long by about a quarter. That is harmless — measured
 * duration always wins, and no estimate may reach a credit calculation
 * (7.02.7).
 *
 * Reveal markers: [[r]] sits in `narration`, immediately before the WORD it
 * reveals. The number of markers in a block MUST equal the length of that
 * block's `reveals` array, or the slide indexes `undefined` and the element
 * never appears. Verify with `npm run generate -- --lesson 02 --dry-run`
 * before spending any API credit.

      "Last lesson asked what makes a waste hazardous. This one asks a different question, and it is the question that actually determines what you have to do about it: [[r]]how much of it do you make. Hazardous waste regulation is scaled to volume. A dental office producing a few kilograms of amalgam waste a month is not held to the standard a refinery is, and that is deliberate. The counting is done [[r]]per calendar month and per site — not per year, not per company. Which of [[r]]three categories you land in that month determines whether you need an identification number, whether you need a manifest, how long you may store the waste, and what training your people need.",

[[r]]No EPA identification number. No manifest in most states. No accumulation time limit at all. What you do have is a duty to send the waste to a facility permitted to receive it, and a [[r]]cap of one thousand kilograms on site at any one time. Many small generators never learn they are regulated at all, because at this level the regulation barely touches them.",

You may hold [[r]]six thousand kilograms on site. You need a designated emergency coordinator, and your people need basic training in handling and response. Since the twenty sixteen Generator Improvements Rule you also have to [[r]]re-notify the agency every four years, which is the requirement most commonly missed.",

You need a written contingency plan with a quick reference guide for emergency responders, and you file a biennial report by the first of March in even years. But note the [[r]]second trigger, because it catches people who are nowhere near a thousand kilograms: more than [[r]]one kilogram a month of acutely hazardous waste — the P list from lesson one — makes you a large quantity generator no matter what your total volume is. One kilogram is about two pounds.",

The exclusion covers residences, and also hotels, campgrounds, and day-use recreation areas. This is not a finding that household chemicals are safe. [[r]]It is a policy judgment that manifesting waste from a hundred and thirty million homes is not administrable. The consequence is that household hazardous waste is managed by collection programs and voluntary participation rather than by legal obligation — which is why your town holds a collection day rather than sending you a manifest.",

Four streams qualify. [[r]]Batteries. [[r]]Pesticides. [[r]]Mercury-containing equipment and lamps, which covers thermostats and fluorescent tubes. And [[r]]aerosol cans, added in twenty nineteen. Universal waste can be accumulated for a year, needs no manifest, and does not count toward your generator category — which is the point. It keeps a school district that changes out fluorescent tubes from being pushed into small quantity generator status by a lighting retrofit. The tradeoff is that it must go to a handler or destination facility, not to a landfill.",

Second, the twenty sixteen rule added relief for exactly that situation: [[r]]one planned or unplanned episodic event per year may be managed under your normal category, provided you notify in advance and meet the conditions.
