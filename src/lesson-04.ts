/**
 * Lesson 04 — "Love Canal and the Birth of Superfund"
 * Course: Where Does It Actually Go? (hazardous waste, ESG/Sustainability)
 *
 * Maps to learning objective 4: explain how the Love Canal disaster led to the
 * creation of Superfund, and describe how contaminated sites are identified,
 * ranked, and paid for. Two assessment questions are tagged to this objective,
 * so the narration must cover BOTH halves — the history and the HRS/NPL
 * mechanism. Blocks 01–05 are the history; 06–08 are the mechanism.
 *
 * SLIDE NOTE: blocks 03, 04, and 07 are chronologies and want a `Timeline`
 * component, which does not exist yet. They are authored as ordered `List`
 * figures. When `Timeline` lands, swapping those figures is a re-render only —
 * narration and reveal counts are unaffected, so the audio survives.
 *
 * DATES: every date and figure in this lesson is checkable against EPA's Love
 * Canal site record and the CERCLA statute. They are the substance of the
 * assessment questions, so they get verified in review rather than trusted.
 *
 * Types are imported from lesson-01, which is the single definition point.
 *
 * Reveal markers: [[r]] sits in `narration`, immediately before the WORD it
 * reveals. Marker count MUST equal `reveals` length. Verify with
 * `npm run generate -- --lesson 04 --dry-run` before spending any credit.

      "Every rule in the last three lessons exists because of a place. In the eighteen nineties an entrepreneur named William Love began digging a [[r]]canal at Niagara Falls to power a model industrial city. The city was never built, the financing collapsed, and what remained was a trench roughly three thousand feet long. Decades later it looked like an asset: a [[r]]clay-lined pit, apparently watertight, in a region that badly needed somewhere to put chemical waste. What happened next is the reason we have manifests, permitted facilities, and a federal cleanup program. And the part worth holding onto from the start is that [[r]]nearly every step was lawful when it was taken. The law arrived thirty-eight years after the first drum went in.",

      "The facts are short and they are not in dispute. The [[r]]site is an abandoned canal in Niagara Falls, New York. Between [[r]]nineteen forty-two and nineteen fifty-three, Hooker Chemical placed roughly twenty-one thousand eight hundred tons of chemical waste into it — drummed and bulk, including solvent residues, pesticide byproducts, and dioxin-bearing material. Then in [[r]]nineteen fifty-three the company sold the covered site to the Niagara Falls Board of Education for one dollar. The [[r]]deed is the detail that makes this a case study rather than merely a scandal: it described the waste, warned against disturbing the cover, and disclaimed all future liability. The seller disclosed. The buyer accepted. And under the law as it then stood, that was the end of the matter.",

First, a [[r]]school opened on the site in nineteen fifty-five and hundreds of homes went up around it, because the land was cheap and the neighborhood was growing. Second, [[r]]sewer lines and road cuts were driven through the clay cap — that cap was the entire containment, and it was breached by ordinary municipal construction. Third, a [[r]]run of unusually wet years raised the water table, and the trench began to behave like a bathtub. Fourth, the contents [[r]]came up: sludge in basements, corroding drums working toward the surface, chemical burns reported on children in the schoolyard, and standing puddles that would not evaporate. No single decision caused this. Four ordinary ones did.",

[[r]]RCRA governs waste that is being generated now. It is prospective and procedural, and it works through permits, categories, and manifests. [[r]]CERCLA reaches backward. It applies to waste already in the ground, put there by companies that may no longer exist, under practices that broke no law at the time.

It is [[r]]joint and several, so where the harm cannot be cleanly divided, one solvent party can be held responsible for the entire cost and left to sue the others for contribution. And it is [[r]]retroactive, reaching conduct that violated nothing when it occurred. The statute names [[r]]four classes of potentially responsible party: the current owner or operator, the owner or operator at the time of disposal, anyone who arranged for disposal — which means the generator, and which is exactly where lesson three ended — and transporters who selected the site.",

A score of [[r]]twenty-eight point five zero or higher makes a site eligible for the National Priorities List.

Superfund was originally a trust fund fed by [[r]]excise taxes on chemical feedstocks and petroleum, on the theory that the industries producing the hazard should capitalize the remedy. That taxing [[r]]authority lapsed in nineteen ninety-five, the balance ran down, and for nearly two decades cleanups were funded from general appropriations — the chemical excise taxes were only reinstated in twenty twenty-two. But the fund was never meant to be the main payer. EPA's stated policy is [[r]]enforcement first, and most cleanups are performed or financed by responsible parties, which is what joint and several liability is for.
