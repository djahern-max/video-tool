/**
 * Lesson 03 — "Cradle to Grave"
 * Course: Where Does It Actually Go? (hazardous waste, ESG/Sustainability)
 *
 * Maps to learning objective 3: trace a shipment of hazardous waste through
 * the cradle-to-grave manifest system from generator to treatment, storage,
 * or disposal facility. Two assessment questions are tagged to this objective,
 * so the narration must actually teach the chain of custody and the exception
 * report clock.
 *
 * SLIDE NOTE: the manifest chain wants a `Flow` component, which does not
 * exist yet. Blocks 04 and 07 are authored as ordered `List` figures instead.
 * When `Flow` lands, those two figures can be swapped without touching the
 * narration or the audio — reveal counts stay the same.
 *
 * Types are imported from lesson-01, which is the single definition point.
 * Do not redefine Block or Figure here — two copies will drift.
 *
 * Reveal markers: [[r]] sits in `narration`, immediately before the WORD it
 * reveals. The number of markers in a block MUST equal the length of that
 * block's `reveals` array. Verify with
 * `npm run generate -- --lesson 03 --dry-run` before spending any credit.

      "Lesson two settled who you are. This lesson follows the waste out the door. Cradle to grave is not a slogan; it is a description of a document. When hazardous waste leaves your site it travels under a [[r]]single tracking number that stays with it from your loading dock to its final resting place. At every handoff, [[r]]each person who takes custody signs for it — you, the transporter, and the facility that finally treats or disposes of it. And critically, the signed record [[r]]comes back to you. If it does not come back within a set number of days, you have a reporting obligation. That return path is what makes the system cradle to grave rather than cradle to gate.",

Each one must be [[r]]marked with the words hazardous waste and with the date accumulation started, because that date is what an inspector counts your ninety or one hundred eighty days from. The shipment must meet [[r]]Department of Transportation rules for packaging, labeling, marking, and placarding, which are a separate body of law in title forty-nine.

Every manifest carries a [[r]]unique tracking number printed on each copy, which is how one shipment stays identifiable through the whole chain. The form [[r]]names three parties: you as the generator, every transporter who will carry it, and one designated facility that has agreed in advance to receive it. And it [[r]]describes the waste precisely — the Department of Transportation shipping name, the EPA waste codes you determined back in lesson one, the quantity, and the number and type of containers.",

At the far end the [[r]]designated facility signs on receipt, which is the moment the waste becomes theirs to treat, store, or dispose of. Then the step people forget: a [[r]]signed copy comes back to you. Each signature is a transfer of custody, and none of them is optional.

A [[r]]small quantity generator has sixty days and a lighter obligation — submit a copy of the manifest with a note saying the return copy never arrived.

And the system pays for itself: the [[r]]facility owes a fee for every manifest submitted, lowest for fully electronic filings and highest for mailed paper. That pricing is deliberate. The point of a national database is that a regulator can now ask a question no filing cabinet could ever answer — where did all of this waste actually go — and get the answer in seconds rather than subpoenas.",

The facility must first [[r]]try to reconcile it, usually with a phone call to the generator. If it remains [[r]]unresolved after fifteen days, the facility sends a letter to the EPA with a copy of the manifest attached.

[[r]]Your status as the generator does not expire when the truck pulls away.
